                  <p class="founderText">
                    The Final Act project was created to be a story telling website. 
                    The website details the murder of  the fictional Maria De Luca, and the 
                    suspects who could have contributed to her murder. The pages in this website include the hero page that 
                    has an image of each character along with a mysterious quote, and a button to take the user to thte suspects page.
                    This website also has a page where the user can interact with the website to collect clues on who
                    the murdere might be. Once the user thinks they may know who they think is the murderer is, there is a page 
                    to guess the murderer. In this website I was tasked with styling, the index page, the suspect page, the about page,
                    and the crime scene page. This project was super fun to make because of the styling. I was able to 
                    really make the colors and fonts match well to give the website an eerie mystery feeling. This project allowed me to grow my 
                    leadership skills as I has to work with other people on what the website would have and how it would look.
                    I was able to take charge on styling while also maintaining an open mind to everyone's ideas.

                  <p class="founderText">
                    The following project was created to show the ways color impacts a 
                    user's experience, and the ways to make the colors on a website more accessible to
                    all people. The landing page answers 5 different questions about how 
                    cololr can effect the user. There is also a gradient with the images that go along with these
                    questions; as you move down the images change color. I had a lot of fun
                    experimenting with different ways to make the layouts and colors of this webpage interesting.
                    Trying to format the images was hard, but after a lot of trial and error I was able to get the 
                    positioning right.
                    I was able to express my creativity to make a aesthetic website. This website also 
                    contains 2 other pages that show the good and bad examples of websites with good color schemes.
                    These 2 pages allowed me to use my JavaScript skills. I did this website by myself.

                  This website was used to compete in Business Professionals of America's Website Design Team
                  Category. This was my first big website project that I had to work on. The website is a to act as a 
                  website for a fiction restaurant named Game Day Grill. I was in charge of the landing page, the menu page,
                  and the order now page. I really loved making this website, but a challenge I had was
                  creating the clickable menu items with JavaScript. This was my first time implementing JavaScript,
                  so I had to work hard to figure out how to add event listeners in order for the buttons to work. 
                  Overall, this was a really fun project that allowed my team, and I to move onto states.

                  to try and use time travel to solve his problems. This website was created collaboratively; I created the 
                  navbar, the carousel landing image, the founder biography, and the packages availible for time travel. 
                  This website allowed me to experiment with the controls on a carousel. I created two carousels
                  for this website, one that automatically moves between images and another that utilizes arrows.

                  This was the second webpage I had ever created. What was unique about making this webpage, is 
                  I did by myself, but I did not make it from scrath. Rather, I was told to recreate a webpage from someone else, and
                  make it look exactly the same. This project made me really use problem solving skills
                  to figure out the exact colors and fonts. I had to use the inspect tool to find the code I was lookikng for.
                  It was also one of my first times using hover which is now a staple skill I use in all websites I create.
                  When hovering over a day in this website the box around the day turns yellow. The wesbite shows the fake 
                  weather in Tokyo for three days.

                  This was my first ever website. Making this website I had lot of challenges, one in particular being the 
                  layout. Ideally, I wanted the website to have 3 columns, but at this point in time I didn't
                  know how or what bootstrap was. Due to this, I had to think outside the box to get everything aligned the way I wanted.
                  I put in text that matched the background color of this website to space out the black text. 
                  This website showcases some of my favorite things to do and eat in the fall with a description alognside.
