                    The Final Act project was created to be a story telling website. 
                    The website details the murder of  the fictional Maria De Luca, and the 
                    suspects who could have contributed to her murder. The pages in this website include the hero page that 
                    has an image of each character along with a mysterious quote, and a button to take the user to thte suspects page.
                    This website also has a page where the user can interact with the website to collect clues on who
                    the murdere might be. Once the user thinks they may know who they think is the murderer is, there is a page 
                    to guess the murderer. In this website I was tasked with styling, the index page, the suspect page, the about page,
                    and the crime scene page. This project was super fun to make because of the styling. I was able to 
                    really make the colors and fonts match well to give the website an eerie mystery feeling. This project allowed me to grow my 
                    leadership skills as I has to work with other people on what the website would have and how it would look.
                    I was able to take charge on styling while also maintaining an open mind to everyone's ideas.
